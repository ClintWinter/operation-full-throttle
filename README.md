# Full Throttle

My stated goal is as follows: Graduate myself from a lowly web developer to a bona fide software engineer.

**This is not set in stone and will grow and change as I do.**

I may repurpose my domain [Devcelerate](https://devcelerate.io) to collect my own cheat sheets and other resources under one roof.

This will require extensive learning/practice in:
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* System Design & Architecture
* Some Networking
* TBD

Resources:
* [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
* [PluralSignt](https://www.pluralsight.com/)
* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
* [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/)
* [LeetCode - Interview Questions](https://leetcode.com/interview/)
* TBD
